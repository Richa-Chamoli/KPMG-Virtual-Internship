# INTRO

I did a virtual internship with KPMG. Their client was Sprocket Central Pvt. Ltd. which is a designing and manufacturing company based in Australia.
My task was to develop a marketing strategy for their company by analyzing their data which was related to the bike related purchases.

# Project Tools:

    Ms-Excel (For cleaning the data)
    Power BI (For ETL process and visualization)

# Data Source:

The data was collected from forage.

The data consists of four data sets:

    Transactions
    New Customer List
    Customer Demographic
    Customer address

# Project Objective:
  Create an interactive dashboard which will help in making an effective marketing strategy.

# Tasks Performed
* Data Quality Assessment: 
After the initial assessment of the data, I found some issues with the data which are as follows:
Inconsistent variables for same attributes in different columns(F, Femal, Female for Female and M and Male for Male which can be written as Male and Female only.
Blank entries in job titles and job descriptions. The blanks can be replaced with others when they are large in number.
Inconsistent data types for same attribute which makes it difficult to analyze data at later stage. So transformations can be done here.
All blank, missing and n/a values can be removed which constitutes a very small portion of the entire data set.

* Data Insights and Model Development:
Build relationships between different tables based on same columns and develop a model.

* Data Insights and Presentation:
All the transformed data should be changed to visuals by creating an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
